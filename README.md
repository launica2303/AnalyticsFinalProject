# Overview
Human trafficking is a worldwide problem that affects millions of people. Traffickers use other humans to generate a profit for themselves at the victim’s expense. The most vulnerable to becoming victims of human trafficking are those who’s basic needs are unmet. The lack of necessities is one of the ways traffickers will prey on victims. Most trafficked victims believe they are indebted to their traffickers in some way or are controlled by the trauma bond they develop with their trafficker. Identifying the signs of human trafficking will help to prevent people from becoming prey to traffickers’ tactics and ensure that current victims can get the help they need to leave.
